# variables: the name of the object in memory where it stores a value (instantiate (create) and assignment)
# assigning variables: we can assign in 2 ways, either with = or <-
# a vector is 1D sequence of numbers or letters (a line with a series of values)
# for bar and foo they are a vector of size 1
# c command in creating vectors means concatenation, simply puts together in the same object multiple values
# for characters we use double quotations
# a vector only contains one type (you can convert a number to a character and not the opposite)
# we can extract an element from a string through slicing []
# single [], we return an object of the same type that you are slicing
# double[], we return an object of the type of the element that you are taking
# lists: collection of other objects, could be vector, tables, a mix of them with lists
# structure of the object is str
# matrix is another shape of object: 2D object (a collection of vectors)
# data frame: a data science object using data.frame, the data should be in the columns we have the variables (parameters) we are measuring
# and in the rows, we have the records or measurements (min 1:23:00) and the cell is the measurement of that variable
# the rows must be uniquely identifiable
# load package using library
# another data structure is tibbles
# data transformation is crucial for modelling
# %>% command + shift + M (acts as a pipe, combining multiple operations together)
