# rep stands for repetition (the value we want to repeat, # of repetitions)
# rep is a function
# we can create a function to remove redundant use of the same code that defines the function in order to reuse it: define a function...we store it in an object 
# arguments are inputs of the function, when we store a function in a variable we are creating the function inside the name of the variable, therefore we use the variable
# the order of arguments (inputs) is important only if when you execute the function, we use positional arguments
# L-apply: it applies a function to an element of the list
# mapping :connect the structure of the data to the shape of the plot


#for loop: repetition of the code in the global environment on a number of elements
# both in the function and for loop: temporary assignment of a variable
